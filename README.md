WEATHER DASHBOARD STEPS
1. Set Up the Project
Create a new directory for your project.
Example: weather-dashboard/
Inside the project folder, create the following files:
index.html – The structure of your web page.
style.css – The styles for your page layout and design.
app.js – The JavaScript file to handle the weather API requests and interaction.
2. Create the HTML Structure (index.html)
Add the basic structure of your webpage:
Input field to enter the city name.
Button to trigger the weather data fetching.
Containers to display weather information (e.g., current temperature, humidity, wind speed).
5-day forecast section (optional but recommended for added functionality).
3. Style the Dashboard (style.css)
Style the page to make it visually appealing.
Center elements, adjust font sizes, and create a clean, user-friendly design.
4. Integrate the Weather API (app.js)
Use JavaScript to fetch weather data from a third-party API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
Add event listeners for user input and handle the API response to display weather data on the dashboard.
5. Add the 5-Day Forecast
Fetch and display a 5-day weather forecast from the API.
Update the HTML to show the forecast for the next five days (showing date, temperature, weather icon, etc.).
6. Test the Dashboard
Test the functionality by entering different city names and checking if the correct weather data is displayed.
Verify that the 5-day forecast is fetched and displayed as expected.
7. Deploy the Application
Host the weather dashboard on a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other web hosting service.
Ensure the API key is properly secured and does not get exposed in the client-side code (you can use environment variables or a back-end server to secure it).
CONCLUSION:
This project will provide users with a functional weather dashboard that shows real-time weather information and forecasts. It’s a great way to practice working with APIs, JavaScript, and web development best practices.
